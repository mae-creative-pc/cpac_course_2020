# Creative Computing Course 2020
A repository to collect coding material for the Polimi's course "Creative Programming and Computing" held by prof. Massimiliano Zanoni in A.Y. 2020/2021

# Your first git commands
To _clone_ the repository, i.e., have a synced copy in your local computer, use the URL https://github.com/mae-creative-pc/cpac_course_2020.git from your Git client. If you feel bold, you can use the git command line

```
git clone https://github.com/mae-creative-pc/cpac_course_2020.git
```
The repository is set as public (everybody can clone it), but only professor and assistants can modify it. If you want to create a new repository starting from this, you can _fork_ the repository on your own Github, by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of the github page.

# Slack Workspace
The course is organized with a Slack Workspace used to share links and have a more prompt communication with students.

Join the workspace by following invitation links in the Beep portal or asking professor Zanoni.
